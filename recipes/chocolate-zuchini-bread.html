    <h2>Ingredients for Chocolate Zucchini Bread:</h2>
    <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this chocolate zucchini bread:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chocolate:</strong> You'll need two types of chocolate: unsweetened 
            chocolate and semisweet chocolate chips.
        </li> 
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Sweeten things up with two cups of white sugar.
        </li> 
        <li><strong>Zucchini:</strong> Make sure to drain the grated zucchini well before 
            incorporating it into the batter. If the zucchini is too wet when incorporated, the 
            batter may not bake correctly.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Oil:</strong> A cup of vegetable oil ensures tender, moist chocolate 
            zucchini bread. If you do not have vegetable oil, other oils with high smoke points will work best. Canola oil, grapeseed, safflower or soybean oil are all great options.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Three eggs lend more moisture and help bind the batter 
            together.
        </li> 
        <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the 
            chocolate zucchini bread.
        </li> 
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> Two cups of all-purpose flour give the chocolate zucchini 
            bread batter structure.
        </li> 
        <li><strong>Baking soda:</strong> A teaspoon of baking soda acts as a leavener, which 
            means it helps the bread rise.
        </li> 
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A teaspoon of salt takes the flavor up a notch, but it won't 
            make the sweet bread taste salty.
        </li> 
        <li><strong>Cinnamon:</strong> A teaspoon of ground cinnamon lends warmth and flavor.</li>
    </ul>
